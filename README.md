# Project Name: 19_React

# Project Description

Using React and the Random users API I created a sortable table with the data from the API

# Assingment Feedback

Parts of this App where very challening. I had to lean heavily on my tutor to get teh Filtering to work as intended. I used Heroku and Github automatic deployment method. This works pretty seemless. I did find out that sometimes when my app goes to sleep it would have to restart the Dynos to get the application to work. I am currently reviewing the logs to see if I can figure out what the issues.

I did find React Strap usefull and I used their Jumbotron component.

Over all I am excited to learn react.
